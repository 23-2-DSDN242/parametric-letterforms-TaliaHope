## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 2

Each letter can be using a set of 11 shapes, each with fixed dimensions(size) but adjustable positioning parameters. Only the necessary shapes are utilised to construct each letter, ensuring efficiency in design. The primary objective of this assignment was to emulate the appearance of tape within the letters. 

Shapes used: 
Each letter is constructed using rectangles. The position can be adjusted using parameters (offsetx, offsety, etc).

Adjustable Parameters per Letter:
offsetx: Controls the horizontal distance of the second circle from the first one, adjusting its position.
offsety: Modifies the vertical displacement of the second circle relative to the first one, allowing for positioning flexibility.

Unadjustable Parameters per Letter:
size: fixed height and width of shapes.

Assignment Objectives:
The objective is to create letters that resemble tape, achieved by using rectangluar shapes and applying lower opacity settings to highlight overlapping tape effects.

Visual Elements:
Opacity - Lower opacity settings emphasize the layered and textured look of tape.
Background Color - A white background simulates a paper-like appearance, enhancing the tape-like visual theme of the letters.

Default Letter Design:
Composition with 11 Shapes: Although there are 11 shapes available, each letter selectively uses only the necessary shapes to create its distinctive appearance.
Default Letter Design: The default representation of the letters resembles a crumpled tape ball, achieved by strategically utilizing all 11 shapes to create a cohesive and textured tape-like structure.
